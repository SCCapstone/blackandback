# blackandback

Web-based automatic photo colorizer.

# Getting Started 

## Prerequisites

Running this code locally requires the following software:

    [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    [Django 2.1.2 (or other compatable version)](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    [Keras](https://keras.io/)

But all that end users need is a photo and an internet connection.

## Note On Operating Systems

A Windows setup is technically possible, but this software is intended to be run on a Linux machine.
