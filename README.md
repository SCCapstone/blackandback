# blackandback

Web-based automatic photo colorizer. Users input a black and white photo and our program colors that photo without any human help.

# Getting Started 

## Prerequisites

Running this code locally requires the following software:

    [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    [Django 2.1.2 (or other compatable version)](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    [Keras](https://keras.io/)
    [Psycopg2]
    [social-auth-app-django]
    [scikit-image]
    [pillow]  

Once you have all the prerequisite software installed, go to the *mysite* directory and start the server using

    sudo python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80

All that end users need is a photo and an internet connection.

## Note On Operating Systems

A Windows setup is possible, but this software is intended to be run on a Linux machine.
